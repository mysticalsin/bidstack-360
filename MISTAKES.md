# MISTAKES — BidStack 360°

Per Tony's `mistakes-protocol.md`:
- Read this BEFORE every task
- Log EVERY mistake immediately (root cause, prevention rule, category)
- Never repeat a logged mistake — if a repeat is detected, HALT and escalate
- After completing a non-trivial fix, write a `docs/solutions/` entry for reuse

### 2026-05-10 TESTING: Industry Zod enum was narrower than seed data
- **What went wrong:** Integration test `POST /opportunities` returned 500 because the `Industry` Zod enum was missing `insurance` (MAPFRE seed) and `transportation` (Logistec seed). The seed wrote those rows directly via Prisma, but the API rejected anything containing the same values on read serialization.
- **Root cause:** I built the Zod schema and the SQL seed in separate sittings and never reconciled them. Closed enums lie in two places and drift if the source of truth isn't enforced.
- **Prevention rule:** When extending a closed enum that constrains an external boundary (HTTP/GraphQL/MCP input), grep every fixture, seed, and migration for literal values of that enum and add a parse-the-fixtures unit test so the build fails on drift. Treat the enum and the seed as one change.
- **Files affected:** `packages/shared/src/schemas/opportunity.ts`, `packages/db/src/seed.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/opportunities.integration.test.ts`.

### 2026-05-10 PROCESS: Master prompt assumed React 19 + Twenty fork as base
- **What went wrong:** Initial framing assumed Twenty CRM uses React 19 and has a stable `ApplicationRegistration` marketplace contract; both turned out to be wrong (React 18.2.39, marketplace WIP, registry path 404).
- **Root cause:** Trusted prose specs without verifying against upstream code.
- **Prevention rule:** Before committing to a fork/extension architecture, spawn an Explore agent to verify the actual upstream tech stack and extension-point contracts. Treat any prose claim about an upstream's internals as a hypothesis until grepped.
- **Files affected:** SPEC.md (architecture decision documented as standalone-first, Twenty overlay preserved for future).
